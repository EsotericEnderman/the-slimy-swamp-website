## What is The Slimy Swamp?

The Slimy Swamp was a planned Minecraft server developed by [@EsotericEnderman](https://github.com/EsotericEnderman) and [@rolyPolyVole](https://github.com/rolyPolyVole), which was planned to be further heavily developed. However, development ceased after [@EsotericEnderman](https://github.com/EsotericEnderman) abandoned the project.

It was essentially the precursor to the [Esoteric Organisation](https://github.com/EsotericOrganisation).
